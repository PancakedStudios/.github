## Hey, we're Pancaked Studios.

A small game development "studio" that... well, makes games.

We're [Nikostormkilla/NikoGameDev,](https://github.com/Nikostormkilla) [Memosek,](https://github.com/Memosek) and [TruncateVirus99.](https://github.com/TruncateVirus99)

Currently working on Chao Adventure, a Chao/Sonic fangame made with GameMaker Studio 2, that makes fun of fanfiction and Changed.

Uhh... see you later? Oh yeah, and you can find us [here](https://pancakedstudios.wordpress.com) as well.
